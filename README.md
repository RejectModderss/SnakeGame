Snake Game in python

For both EXE n IDE version, make sure to download the mp3 files, they will NOT work unless you use them.

If you wanna add more or edit the source, then go ahead, made it for fun to be honest.

I also added the exe version just incase you wanna play on the exe version instead of using an IDE.

# Credits
I got most of the source from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfRwxS5d0SI
I changed most of it in a certain way, I made it better in my opinion.
